<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard <strong>markup language</strong>
for documents designed to be displayed in <u>a web browser.</u> It can be assisted by
technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such
as JavaScript.<br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
 render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
document.</br>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
rendered page.</p> <p>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
 structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
 quotes and other items.</p> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
 angle brackets.Tags such as <img src="coding.jpg"width="100%""> and <input> directly introduce content
  into the page. Other tags such as  surround and provide information about
    document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page</body>
